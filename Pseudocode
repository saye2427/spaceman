# Spaceman!!! Game

Section 1: Generate a Random word
-Drawing either from a coded repo of words, or some sort of dictionary library,
use a random function to pick a word.
-If it is a coded repo (perhaps easier in this regard)--display the category of
word

Section 2: User View (will i be storing user inputs, or showing them?)
-Count the number of characters in the chosen word, and display the corresponding
number of blank spaces

Section 3: User Inputs and Consequences
-Prompt the user to enter a letter
-Maybe keep a record of which letters have been used in an empty list, appended
with every entry (and display it in the terminal) // Conversely, can have is so that
only the remaining letters are displayed
    o Do not allow re-entry of letters!
-For every entry, check character string of chosen word, and return EVERY instance of
that letter, otherwise a "print" statement declaring that the letter is incorrect
    o Stretch: For every incorrect entry, keep a tally for suspense--a visual would be
    even better!!!

Section 4: 7 incorrect
-If 7 incorrect letters are entered, display a print statement about spaceman flying away,
terminal art (more difficult), or maybe connect to an automatically opening GIF (localhost?)

Section 5: <7 incorrect + A complete word!!!
-If the word is completed before the incorrect words list contains 7 entries,
display some sort of GOOD JOB, or some sort of awesome GIF? XD

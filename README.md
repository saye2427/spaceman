# "Spaceman" Project

In a marvelous parody of the word game "Hangman," this project utilizes Python to have the user guess all the letters in a randomly generated word...within 7 tries!!! And if not, Spaceman (as opposed to the morbidly destined Hangman) will be sent into the far reaches of space!!!

o(O_O)o - o(O_O)o - o(O_O)o - o(O_O)o - o(O_O)o - o(O_O)o - o(O_O)o - o(O_O)o
